1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,369
All across the country
right now, as you know,

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,372
states are trying their best
to handle the coronavirus,

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,040
and they're doing it
in different ways.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,710
And New York has taken
social distancing so seriously

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,312
that Mayor Bill de Blasio
has now announced

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,449
that he's gonna start ripping
down basketball hoops

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,850
out of all the city parks

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,186
so that people don't want
to go and play there.

9
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,522
Oh, and, fun fact, de Blasio
is the only mayor in America

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,992
who has to bend down
when he rips out the hoops.

11
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,393
Oh!

12
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,595
So, that's what's happening
in New York.

13
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,731
But other states
are taking a different approach

14
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,932
to keep themselves safe,

15
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:35,002
uh, hanging up
a "no trespassing" sign.

16
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,804
REPORTER: Fly to Florida
and it will really cost you.

17
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,540
You're going to have
to self-isolate for two weeks

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,742
before do you anything else.

19
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,077
Hopefully, that will be
a deterrent for people.

20
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,747
If you're just simply trying
to escape here,

21
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,383
uh, to avoid the restrictions
that have been put in place

22
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:53,553
in your own state, that is
probably not a good idea.

23
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,356
Meantime, both Alaska and Hawaii
are now requiring

24
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:00,160
mandatory 14-day quarantines for
everyone entering their states.

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,095
REPORTER 2: They say
if you aren't able to comply

26
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,230
with the quarantine,

27
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,432
you will need
to postpone your trip.

28
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:09,569
I hope that everyone complies
and visitors do not come here.

29
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,774
We do want those who may have
scheduled trips to the islands--

30
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:17,244
take the action to cancel
or reschedule their trip.

31
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,712
Yeah, that's right.

32
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,648
If you try and get off the plane
in Alaska,

33
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,483
Hawaii, or Florida,

34
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,018
instead of a guy with a sign

35
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,353
holding up your name
at the airport,

36
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,821
people just have a sign
that says,

37
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,890
"Turn around, dick."

38
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,758
And, I mean, I'm assuming
your name is Dick.

39
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,760
I mean, they could write
"Richard," if you prefer that.

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,429
They just-- "Turn around"
and the person.

41
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,165
But if these states really want
to keep people out,

42
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,168
instead of tourism ads,
you know what they need?

43
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,371
They need to make
some anti-tourism ads.

44
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,973
In fact,

45
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,708
we did it for them.
