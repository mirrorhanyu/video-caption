and clean as many things

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,371
as possible, things that
you regularly touch,

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:05,572
just to keep them safe.

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,043

services inside your home,

00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,213
such as tables, chairs,
door knobs, light switches.

your upholstery.

should be cleaning

your phone as much as

or soap and water,
then get to cleaning.
