1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
all across the country right now as you

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,609
know states are trying their best to

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,529
handle the corona virus and they're

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,389
doing it in different ways and New York

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,759
is taking social distancing so seriously

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,679
that Mayor Bill de Blasio has now

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,049
announced that he's gonna start ripping

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,090
down basketball hoops out of all the

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,020
city parks so that people don't want to

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,480
go and play there

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,340
oh and fun fact de Blasio was the only

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,300
mayor in America who has to bend down

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,160
when he rips out the hoops oh so that's

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,300
what's happening in New York but other

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,510
states are taking a different approach

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,360
to keep themselves safe hanging up a no

17
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,250
trespassing sign fly to Florida and it

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,320
will really cost you you're going to

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,149
have to self isolate for two weeks

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,010
before you do anything else hopefully

21
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,469
that will be a deterrent for people if

22
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,660
you're just simply trying to escape here

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,879
to avoid the restrictions that have been

24
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,460
put in place in your own state that is

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,680
probably not a good idea

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,320
meantime both Alaska and Hawaii are now

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,359
requiring mandatory 14-day quarantines

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,309
for everyone entering their states they

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,559
say if you aren't able to comply with

30
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,689
the quarantine you will need to postpone

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,020
your trip I hope that everyone complies

32
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:13,049
and visitors do not come here we do want

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,630
those who may have scheduled trips to

34
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,150
the islands take the option to cancel or

35
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,909
reschedule their trip yeah that's right

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,939
if you try and get off the plane in

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,560
Alaska Hawaii or Florida instead of a

38
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,210
guy with a sign holding up your name at

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,360
the airport people just have a sign that

40
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,860
says turn around dick and I mean I'm

41
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,390
assuming your name is dick I mean they

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,520
could write Richard if you prefer that

43
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,259
they just turn around and the person but

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,229
if these states really want to keep

45
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,000
people out instead of tourism ads you

46
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,770
know what they need they need to make

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,670
some anti tourism ads in fact we did it

48
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,080
for them Hawaii with its sandy beaches

49
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,050

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,450
people Hawaii is heaven on earth or at

51
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,030

52
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,340
came and infected us for now on to stay
